# 3-Phase Traction Inverter (Simulink)

This project models a **3-phase traction inverter** using **MATLAB Simulink**, driven by a **100V DC source** and modulated using **Sinusoidal PWM (SPWM)**. The goal is to simulate realistic line and phase voltages that closely approximate a sine wave.

## Features

- ✅ DC input voltage: **100V**
- ✅ SPWM generation using reference sine waves and carrier signals
- ✅ MOSFET-based inverter leg switching
- ✅ Output: 3-phase AC waveforms (line-to-line and phase voltages)
- ✅ Scope visualization of voltage outputs

## System Overview

- **Input Source:** 100V DC
- **Control Technique:** Sinusoidal Pulse Width Modulation (SPWM)
- **Switching Devices:** MOSFETs (ideal or with internal resistance)
- **Output:** Three-phase AC output for motor or load simulation
